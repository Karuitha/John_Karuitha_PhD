The analysis shows that Japanese vehicles have significantly lower fuel consumption. Is this the reason Japanese cars rule the roads all over the world?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!require(pacman)) {\n        install.packages(\"pacman\")\n        library(pacman)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: pacman\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse)\n\n\ndata(\"mpg\")\n#head(mpg)\n\n## There is high correlation between highway and city fuel consumption.
