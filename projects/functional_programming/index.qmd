The purrr (Henry and Wickham 2020) package is part of the tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) and contains functions that allow us to;

Apply named or anonymous functions to vectors or lists.

Save the results in a variety of convenient formats.

For instance, you could have data in a series of Ms Excel documents and desire to combine them into one data set. Similarly, you could use purrr to generate a series of reports customised to an audience.
