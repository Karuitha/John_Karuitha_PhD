In this short report, I will work with the pressure and cars datasets that are inbuilt in R. I will start by plotting the pressure dataset, and then capture the top six (6) rows of the cars dataset. I will also use an appropriate theme to colour the fonts of my graph and tables. Finally, I will publish the report to rpubs.
