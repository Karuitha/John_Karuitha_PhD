This post is a visualization of motor vehicle fuel consumption using R and ggplot2. The analysis shows that Japanese vehicles have significantly lower fuel consumption. Is this the reason Japanese cars rule the roads all over the world?

I start by loading the packages required for the analysis. 

```{r}
if (!require(pacman)) {
        install.packages("pacman")
        library(pacman)
}

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, Amelia)

```

Next, I lad and examine the data for missing values.

```{r}

data("mpg")

## Glimpse the data ----
glimpse(mpg)

## Missing data
Amelia::missmap(mpg)
```

In this section, I check the correlation between highway fuel consumption vs city fuel consumption. It turns out that there is a high correlation. Thus, there is no trade-off. No vehicle that consumes more in the highway will consume less in the city. 

```{r}
## There is high correlation between highway and city fuel consumption. Again, vehicles with more cylinders generally consume more fuel per mile/ kilometer.

mpg %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(
        x = cty, y = hwy,
        size = cyl, color = manufacturer
)) +
        geom_point() +
        theme_classic() +
        theme(axis.line = element_blank()) + 
    labs(x = "City", y = "Highway",
         title = "Correlation Between City and Highway Fuel Consuption by Vehicle Model",
         subtitle = "There is a high correlation between city and highway fuel consumption.")


```

Finally, I visualize the fuel economy of the cars by manufacturer. It is clear from the visual that cars made in Japan are more fuel efficient. 

```{r}
## Japanese cars are very fuel efficient. 
mpg %>%
        ggplot(mapping = aes(
                x = fct_reorder(manufacturer, cty, median),
                y = cty
        )) +
        geom_boxplot(aes(fill = manufacturer %in% c("toyota", "nissan", "subaru", "honda")),
                show.legend = FALSE
        ) +
        geom_point(shape = ".") +
        artyfarty::theme_ft() +
        theme(axis.line = element_blank()
              ) +
        labs(
                x = NULL, y = NULL, 
                title = "City Fuel Consumption by Vehicle Make",
                subtitle = "Cars made in Japan are More Fuel Efficient"
        ) +
        scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray 80", "black")) 

```
