In this project, I demonstrate how to extract data from multiple excel files nested in different folders and sub-folders. Ordinarily, this data would require a person to open each folder and sub-folder. Next, open each Ms Excel file inside the folders or sub-folders, and then copy-paste the content of each of the Excel files to a master Excel file.

Copy-pasting is viable when dealing with a few data files. However, even for a very efficient Ms Excel user, cutting and pasting data from 200 Ms Excel files to create one data set is a tall order. Fortunately, the R programming language makes such tasks easy and fast.

I start by loading the required packages. Note that this step requires an internet connection.
