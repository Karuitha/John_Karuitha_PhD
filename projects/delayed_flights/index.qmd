Flight delays are a significant concern in the airline industry. Apart from the inconvenience caused to travelers, delays also affect the reputation of airlines, negatively impacting market share. In this analysis, I utilize data for flights between New York and Washington DC. The central questions in the analysis are;

- Which factors have a significant relationship to flight delays?
- Can machine learning be useful in predicting flight delays?
